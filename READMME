Generating the Smart Contract Using Hardhat

Smart Contract Setup
In the Hardhat folder, there is a contracts directory containing a contract file named MyNFT.sol.

Generate the metadata of contract using following command:
node generateMetaData.js

Need to follow the steps :
1. Upload the metadata JSON file to Pinata Cloud.
2. After the upload, you will receive a CID (Content Identifier).
3. Create a wallet using MetaMask, where you will obtain the private key.
4. Sign up for an account on Infura, which will provide you with an RPC link.


Compiling the Contract

To compile the contract:
Open the shell and navigate to the root folder (hardhat).
Run the following command:
npx hardhat compile

Deploying the Contract
After compiling the contract, deploy it to get the contract address:

Run the following command in the shell:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mainnet

Executing the Minting Script
Once you have the contract address, execute the minting script to generate the NFTs:
Navigate to the root folder (NFT-MINTING) in the shell.
Run the command:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mainnet
